    <h1>Hissy Fits</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hissy fits.  What on earth are they?  If you weren't born and raised in the South, you may not know, but once you've seen one, you won't likely forget it any time soon.</p>
    <h2>What exactly is a Hissy Fit?</h2>
    <p>Hissy fit - noun. A sudden outburst of temper, often used to describe female anger at something trivial. Originally regional from American South. Thought to originate from contraction of "hysterical fit."
        She threw a hissy fit when she found out the last pair of shoes had been sold. Urban Dictionary</p>
   
        <h2>What DOES a hissy fit look like?</h2>

        <p>This would be a mild to moderate hissy fit.  Hissy fits are characterized by a creative mixture of crying, flailing of arms and legs, and dramatic pauses followed by abrupt screaming and basic hystrionics. The dramatic pause typically provides the audience an opportunity to intervene by providing the hissy fitter with whatever it is she is lacking. Giving the hissy fitter exactly what she wants typically results in an immediate end to the hissy fit, but BEWARE, giving in to the hissy fitter encourages the hissy fitter to have a hissy fit more often and if need be, escalate to the more disturbing FULL BLOWN HISSY FIT.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>Who Has These Hissy Fits?</h2>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, anyone can have a full-blown hissy fit at any given time and place. Although children are well-known to have hissy fits often for just about any given reason, adults are just as prone to have a good hissy given the right circumstances.</p>

<h2>Are Hissy Fits Justified?</h2>
<p>Certainly!  Sometimes, a good hissy fit just makes you feel better and releases all of the pint-up emotional baggage you carry around from driving in traffic, or working, or being a human.</p>
